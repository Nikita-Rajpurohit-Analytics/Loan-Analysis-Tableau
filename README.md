This project focuses on turning raw bank loan data into actionable insights that address real business challenges in lending. The central problem was the difficulty of tracking loan performance, distinguishing good loans from bad loans, and identifying the key drivers of defaults.
The work began with cleaning and preparing the dataset in Excel, followed by defining critical KPIs such as loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. 



Using Tableau, I built  interactive dashboards to monitor these KPIs in real time, highlight portfolio health, and allow drill-down analysis at borrower and loan status levels.




The analysis uncovered important risk patternsâ€”for example, defaults were more likely among borrowers with high DTIs, short employment histories, and certain loan purposes like small business financing. Beyond visualizing these findings, the project also proposed practical strategies such as strengthening eligibility checks, deploying region-specific lending approaches, and implementing early-warning systems to flag at-risk borrowers.



By combining data analysis with interactive visualizations and actionable recommendations, this project demonstrates how analytics can directly reduce defaults, improve portfolio management, and support smarter, data-driven lending strategies.
